	• Replication controller is used to orchestrate containers by creating multiple instances of pod.

	• Replication controller and replicaset both have almost same configuration except that replicaset have a selector field in which we define match labels which has the same value as that of labels under pod definition.

	• Selector field is used so that replicaset knows which pod has to be created (in case of scaling the pods which are not pre available) or monitored (existing pods).

	• Sample replicaset definition file:

		apiVersion: apps/v1
		Kind: Replicaset
		metadata:
		  name: myapp-replicaset
		  labels:
		    app: myapp
		    type: frontend
		Spec:
		    template:                                        #this is pod definition
		      metadata:
		         name: myapp-pod
		         labels:
		           name: myapp
		           type: frontend
		      spec:
		         containers:
		          - name: nginx-container
		             image: nginx
		   replicas: 3
		   selector:
		       matchLabels:
		         name: myapp
   

	• Selector matchlabels should have same value as pod labels because then only repliacset will know which pod is to be monitored and scaled.
