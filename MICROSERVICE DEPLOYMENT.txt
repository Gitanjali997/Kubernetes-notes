	• For every microservice we need to have separate pod/deployment definition file and service definition file and needs to be deployed separately.

	• For user facing applications we should use node port service and for backend services/applications we should use clusterIP service if these services are to be accessed by other servers or frontend servers.

		Spec:
		 containers:
		  - name:
		     image:
		     ports:
		     env:
		      - name: POSTGRES_USER
		        value: "postgres"
		      - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
		        value: "postgres"
