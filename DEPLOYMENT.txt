	• The deployment provides us with the capability to upgrade the underlying instances seamlessly using rolling updates, Undo changes and pause and resume changes as required.
	• In case a new deployment is to be made so rolling update strategy is used by default in which one pod is made down at a time and in place of it new pod is brought up and so on.

	• Deployment manifest file:
