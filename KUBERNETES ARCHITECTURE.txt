	• NODE: node is a machine physical or virtual on which k8s is installed and that is where containers will be launched by k8s.

	• CLUSTER: A Cluster is a set of nodes grouped together. This way even if one node fails you have your application still accessible from the other nodes. Moreover having multiple nodes helps in sharing load as well.

	• MASTER: The Master is another node with Kubernetes installed in it and is configured as a Master. The master watches over the nodes in the cluster and is responsible for the actual orchestration of containers on the worker nodes.

	• When you install Kubernetes on a system, you're actually installing the following components:

		○ API SERVER: The API server acts as the front end for Kubernetes. The users, management devices, command line interfaces, all talk to the API server to interact with Kubernetes cluster.
		
		○ ETCD: Etcd is a distributed reliable key value store used by Kubernetes to store all data used to manage the cluster. Think of it this way. When you have multiple nodes and multiple Masters in your cluster, Etcd stores all that information on all the nodes in the cluster in a distributed manner. Etcd is responsible for implementing locks within the cluster to ensure that there are no conflicts between the Masters.
		 
		○ SCHEDULER: The Scheduler is responsible for distributing work or containers across multiple nodes. It looks for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes.
	
		○ CONTROLLER: The controllers are the brain behind orchestration. They are responsible for noticing and responding when nodes, containers or end points goes down. The controllers make decisions to bring up new containers in such cases.
	
		○ CONTAINER RUNTIME: The Container Runtime is the underlying software that is used to run containers like docker etc.
		
		○ KUBELET: Kubelet is the agent that runs on each node in the cluster. The agent is responsible for making sure that the containers are running on the nodes as expected.
	
	• The above components are distributed to worker nodes and masters as: 

		○ In master: kube-apiserver, etcd, controller, scheduler
		○ In worker: kube-runtime, kubelet
	
	• Kubectl: it is a command line utility. The kubectl tool is used to deploy and manage applications on a Kubernetes cluster. To get cluster information, to get the status of other nodes in the cluster and to manage many other things.
